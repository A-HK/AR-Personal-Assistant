## Goal
Our goal is to provide a virtual vacation experience for people who are unable to leave their homes due to physical limitations or other reasons. Using Augmented Reality technology, we aim to create an immersive and interactive experience that allows users to explore a variety of different vacation themes, including jungle safaris, theme park rides, beach trips, yoga retreats, etc.

The AR Vacation Experience will be available as a web app/PWA and can be used with smartphones and tablets that are equipped with AR capabilities. The app will be compatible with both iOS and Android devices.

## Contribution

We are currently in the development phase of this project and are working hard to create an engaging and realistic experience that will allow users to escape the confines of their homes and explore new environments. We will be updating this repository with progress updates and plans for future developments.

We are excited to share this project with you and look forward to hearing your feedback and suggestions as we continue to develop it. If you would like to contribute to the project, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request. Together, we can create a fun and interactive way for people to enjoy a vacation experience right from the comfort of their own homes!
