## Welcome to the AR Personal Assistant.
This project aims to make a personal assistant that utilizes Augmented Reality (AR) technology to help users answer their daily queries and perform tasks with a human touch. The AR feature allows users to interact with the assistant in a more immersive and interactive way, making the experience more engaging.

Some of the use cases such assistant can help you with include:

Getting directions or recommendations in a virtual environment
Setting reminders or alarms
Playing music or media, and answering questions
In addition to these everyday tasks, the assistant also has potential for educational and training purposes. Users can learn new skills or information in a virtual augmented environment, making the learning experience more interactive and engaging.

We are excited to see the potential of this AR assistant and hope it can make a positive impact in people's daily lives. Stay tuned for updates and release!

## Use cases
There are mainly 4 use-cases that we provide as follows,
- [Play Spotify Music in AR](#ar-spotify-music)
- [Virtual Fitness Trainer](#fitness-trainer)
- [Virtual Tour Guide](#tour-guide)
- [Daily Assistant](#daily-assistant)

### [Virtual Fitness Trainer](https://ar-personal-assistant-xros.vercel.app/fitnesstrainer)

If you’re a health freak, but don’t get enough time to go out to the gym then we have you covered here with our <b>Virtual Fitness Trainer</b>.
This use case is all about providing a Gym Trainer or Yoga Coach virtually and in a more immersive way for free. 

In this service, users will be provided some workouts and yoga to try out. There are dedicated web pages to perform each workout/yoga. On that page they will get more details about that exercise and 3D Virtual Trainers demonstrating that exercise. These 3D animated trainer models are built using [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) and rendered using [React Three Fibre](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber)

Next, users can actually perform the exercise in front of camera on this platform and the performance will be tracked by our AI-based Body-tracking system built using [Tenserflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/examples/pose_estimation/overview) and [Mediapipe](https://mediapipe-studio.webapps.google.com/home). It will keep a track of performed reps or pose time and let the user know via voice making it a hands-free experience.

Last but not least, users can observe the Virtual Fitness Trainer in their own environment by entering the AR mode on their phones. This will actually help users visualize a particular exercise better and understand the best way to do it. This AR experience is also built using [React Three Fibre](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber).
